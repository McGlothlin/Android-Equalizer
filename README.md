Early work in progress. This project serves three purposes for me:

1. Learn Android development
2. Learn Kotlin
3. Create my own equalizer

My phone's equalizer isn't working correctly so I thought I'd write my own. Additionally, every equalizer I've ever used has fallen short in the functionality it offered, so I want to see what I can do to improve some of the existing designs I've seen out there.
