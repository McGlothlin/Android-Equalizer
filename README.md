This project serves three purposes for me:

1. Learn Android development
2. Learn Kotlin
3. Create my own equalizer

My phone's equalizer isn't working correctly so I thought I'd write my own. Additionally, every equalizer I've ever used has fallen short in the functionality it offered, so I want to see what I can do to improve some of the existing designs I've seen out there.

I've started off with a project originally created by Kevin Boone. The MainActivity has been converted to Kotlin. I've read that global equalizer functionality is deprecated (see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/Equalizer) so I built Kevin's project from source and ran it on my phone to make sure this was actually still possible. Since it worked OK I plan to reverse engineer the MainActivity and add onto it until I have something that's useful for me.
